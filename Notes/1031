Hash Table, no order
Insert: O(1)
Delete: O(1)
Search: O(1)
--------------------
hash table used to implement dicitonaries
difference being in dictionaries keys have to be strings and a hash table isn't iterable
keys must be immutable; strings are immutable
hash function: takes data and turns it into and integer
eg. to hash; hash the password
system hash()
hash table: list of list of tuples

if n is size of data
and b is # of bucket
n/b is "load factor"
choose b: n<b<2n


Balanced Binary Search Tree, order support
Insert: O(logn)
Delete: O(logn)
Search: O(logn)


Skip List
Insert: O(1)
Delete: O(1)
Search: O(1)
